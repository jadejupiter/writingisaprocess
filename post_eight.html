                    <br>
                    <p>There has been a STAGNATION with my blog posts, and I won’t lie and say that 
                      I’ve been writing the whole time. Actually, big surprise to no one, I have NOT been 
                      writing. A fun fact not yet revealed, I am a uni student in my <i>FINAL</i> year 
                      of undergrad. Everything else has been a factor, whether that be planning for the 
                      future, the harsh reality that I may not see a handful of my uni friends after 
                      graduation, and that I’m growing up.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All of that? Not the best support to get into a creative state of mind. However, 
                      there is one thing that acts as my respite, and I have been doing that a lot more 
                      lately:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>Table-Top Roleplay Games</i>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>TTRPGS are not a new thing for many creative people, it’s yet another outlet to be 
                      creative. I have been playing a myriad of ttrpgs in the past couple of months, and 
                      frankly? They’ve been one of the few reasons I’ve been able to even function.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I’m in three stories/campaigns right now, but my main focus will be the DND one. 
                      My wonderful friend has been running this for a year now, and I’ve been a part since 
                      session 1 (one). My character is a human paladin, Opal, and when I started playing 
                      her? Very bare-bones. Serves a princess, is a holy knight, kinda stoic, and has an 
                      affinity for healing. That was all there was to her.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now as a writer, you would say “Hey Emma, that’s really flat,” and YOU WOULD BE 
                      CORRECT! It <i>IS</i> very flat for a character, she has no motivations, no drive, 
                      and no real sense of <i>why</i>. 
                    </p>
                  <br>
                    <p>So I started to do something that was inspired by my fellow players. <i>I wrote a 
                      backstory</i>. Without having to think of a world and place to set her in, a 
                      character just flowed. A backstory with a family, a personality for her, motives, 
                      what makes her angry, what makes her cry, what makes her <i>feel</i>. And frankly, 
                      it got me into a writing mood.
                    </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Getting to step back and also embody the character in a way that does not require 
                    writing, but rather playing a game with friends as–I would say–ignites the embers 
                    beginning to fizzle out within my writer spirit. I’d recommend it to writers. Play a 
                    game with your friends, you may just find an open door of “oh my god, this totally 
                    happened in [insert character name]’s past, I have to write this to share with my table” 
                    that’ll end with you realizing you ARE writing again.
