                    <br>
                    <p>Every written piece ever started with an idea. Reading a book, listening to
                         music, observing the world around you; everything ever was inspired by 
                         something. When that idea bleeds into the margin of your notes, voice 
                         memos of your phone, or even a whole collection of sticky-notes itself, 
                         THAT’S where an idea that NEEDS to be written begins.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I’ve personally had this happen to me a fair-few times, where every-other-thought 
                        in my head was related to an idea, character, or story just 
                        aching to be told. It evolved into a collection of scrap papers with 
                        blurbs, folders of half-baked ideas, but nothing more. I know over a good 
                        handful of writers who’ve experienced this, the lightning-strike of 
                        inspiration coursing through the mind and body, but never reaching the 
                        final outlet of actually sitting down and writing.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The story I’m working on right now started as a jotted idea on a blue 
                        sticky note around 5-ish years ago. Since then, I’ve named and 
                        characterized (very very loosely) the main characters, given myself visual
                        references for them, collected a good chunk of world building bits cut 
                        out of coursework notes, and half-baked scenes on loose leaf and notes 
                        apps. The plot jumps around in my head, but the main themes have been 
                        pretty clear since the idea’s conceptualization all those years ago. 
                    </p>

                        Like any writer, my worst enemy has been writer’s block and an inability 
                        to know where to start this. Sure, I can sit and free-write, but about 
                        what? What aspects do I write out? Should it be out of order? Am I going 
                        to patchwork-quilt this story together scene by scene? THAT is what I want
                        to know, and unlike most creative writers, I’m going to get 
                        scientifically-minded about this. Like in any merit-holding 
                        scientific study, I’m going to hypothesize what’ll come from this and see 
                        how it goes. See if having an outside force (you, the reader) following 
                        the process will yield any different results (finally get past writer’s 
                        block and like a ‘creative stagnation’ of sorts)!!!
