                    <br>
                    <p>As I said in my last post, I am someone quick to fall to the whims of
                     writer’s block. Faced with any myriad of writing issues, a creative block, 
                     a starting-this-shit block, or just anything else that interrupts my flow 
                     state, I find that there is one thing that can get me focused again. A blank
                      notebook and a “fancy” pencil.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        There’s also no comparable feeling (to me) creatively than having a couple
                         blank pages where you can just write out any and all ideas in your head,
                          just to reorder them later. It engages more of your senses, writing in 
                          a notebook as compared to typing on a laptop to generate ideas. You have
                           to feel the paper under your fingers, be consciously aware of where 
                           you’re writing. The scraping of pencil lead on paper, the shorthand 
                           messes that usually generate from fits of creative passion. The physical 
                           feeling of moving a pencil on paper. And personally, as a right-handed 
                           person, I end up with a mess of graphite smudges on my hand 
                           (specifically the outer part of my palm that extends from my pinkie, 
                           which had rested on the paper). It’s unlike any other feeling, 
                           especially when you see that you’ve been just head-down flow-state-ing 
                           it for like 30+ minutes, and look down to see smudges along your hand, 
                           a whole spread of ideas physically there, and usually a VERY dull pencil. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        When I want to really really commit to writing something, I will almost 
                        peer-pressure myself to deck-out my notebook and use “fancy” pencils/pens 
                        (we’ll touch-base on that MUCH later). That way, there feels like there’s 
                        stakes, an almost guilt that’ll come with putting attention and time into 
                        the visuals of a project where you think “fuck it, guess I DO have do 
                        writing/think about/work on this project, I used my cool stickers for 
                        this notebook”. I like to think of the 3 main essentials when getting a 
                        notebook “ready”: </p>
                    <br>
                        <p>1. What’re some themes/plot-aspects I have in mind for this project?</p>
                        <p>2. Are there some pieces/points of inspiration for me?</p>
                        <p>3. What will I like looking at? </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                         My stickers always carry a meaning. For themes, I want to have stickers
                        that connect/remind me of the ideas I have for the story just when 
                        reaching for it. I’m also a firm believer that art inspires other art 
                        and everything ever made was inspired by SOMETHING else. In that same 
                        vein, I like to have reminders of all my inspirations for a work 
                        front-and-center. Sometimes, that’ll be a literal list of inspirations 
                        amongst the first couple pages of my notebook, other times it’s having 
                        stickers from those pieces of media on my notebook. The last point of 
                        “what I want to look at” is my “prettify” aspect of notebooks. Those are
                        stickers that just keep me going, get a good laugh out of me, or serve 
                        as overall writer inspiration. I’ll use my notebook for the story I’m 
                        working on in tandem with this blog as an example.
                    </p>

                    The stickers to the left are both related to themes/aspects of my story, 
                    being Pandora and a take on “live, laugh, love”. With Pandora, the story will 
                    have this overarching theme of knowledge and the consequences that come from 
                    knowing/learning things. The top is a bit funnier but also a reminder that the 
                    characters that die within this story still remain relevant and relative to the plot. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p><img src="/Users/esilva/Desktop/blogpostpics/inspo_aspects of story_image.png" style="float:right;width:300px;height:200px;">
                        For the inspirations from other works (seen to the right) I literally have 
                        stickers from other forms of media. It’s a superhero story that’s meant to 
                        hit-home with the reader-base, thus a Superman “being kind is punk-rock” 
                        sticker. The one above is from a series, “Tokyo Ghoul” which is a main force 
                        behind the inspiration for this story, and why the characters are usually 
                        masked within this world. Seeing both these physical factors can sometimes 
                        serve as points of further inspiration sometimes too.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><img src="/Users/esilva/Desktop/blogpostpics/what_i_like_aspects of story_image.png" style="float:left;width:250px;height:200px;">
                        The last aspect “what I like to see” comes in with these last two stickers. 
                        The top on the front was a sticker gifted from a friend, which holds no 
                        relevance (outside maybe the “power of friendship”) but I just like it. The 
                        back one, however, does relate to themes of being an author as a whole. Books 
                        are a driving force for me, they’re relevant, and I like this sticker. Thus, 
                        it’s here.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>These little factors–like a pretty notebook–just add some nuance to the 
                        writing process, acting as another form of inspiration and developing the 
                        idea. If you ever need that extra “push” to just start, start with 
                        something a lot less stressful than the beginning of the story, start 
                        with a notebook.
