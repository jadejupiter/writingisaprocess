                    <br>
                    <p>I grew up HATING English classes. Hated silent reading time, hated the 
                        weekly trips to the school library to pick out a library book. I’d try to 
                        get around it, with comics and graphic novels, or just end up choosing 
                        the SHORTEST very below my reading level books. Up until the middle of 
                        elementary school, that’s just how things were, I was a math person and a 
                        visual artist.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>That all changed, however, when my mother and fourth grade teacher staged 
                        kind of an intervention of sorts of my 11-year-old self. My teacher knew 
                        I could read at a higher level than I was, and my mother (also a teacher, 
                        that part’s important) knew I could too. So I was told that I needed to 
                        read more my-age books, and my mother took me to the nearest bookstore. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the back of the children’s section, my mom pulled books that she thought 
                        would interest me. She’d flip to a random page and see if I could read 
                        all the words on it, and that’d be her system of testing my reading level 
                        (I’d try to mispronounce words as I theoretically could on purpose).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After our usual back and forth, she pulled one book from the wall of kids 
                        books, and read the back, smiled, and flipped to a random page. Giving me 
                        the book, she had me read the page, and one word stood out. Mermaid. As 
                        much as I wanted NOT to enjoy it, mermaids got me. I ended up reading that 
                        book in hour-long intervals that week, making my way through books one and 
                        two within the month.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My fourth grade teacher pulled me aside–I remember–after I’d submitted my 
                        required reading log and little summary paragraph for the week, and asked 
                        what’d changed. I told her that I liked reading now. She’d known that, 
                        saying something along the lines of “just needing to find what I liked to 
                        read” (thanks Mrs. Murray).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> That one push to read changed the direction of my entire life, to put it 
                        lightly. A love for mermaids and mythological creatures turned into a love 
                        for fantasy books, then a love for reading longer crafted words and 
                        supernatural stories, and eventually, a desire to write. My first “story” 
                        of sorts was written about a year later, when I started becoming a real 
                        wordsmith (or as eloquitely put as a fifth-grader could be for a collaborative 
                        superhero story with friends), and as the years went on, I only wrote more and more. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When high school hit, I knew I wanted to be an author. With bookshelves lined 
                        with stories that bounced around in my mind at all times, to getting my first 
                        job at the very bookstore where I had my reading-love sparked, I knew I 
                        wanted to write stories people would read. Make something that some kid would 
                        pull off the shelf at the age I did, and fall head-over-heels in love with. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But saying you want to write is easier than <i>actually</i> sitting down to do it. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The past six-ish years have been like that, writing smaller pieces, keeping 
                        them to myself, and trying to work on this big piece that pulled from so many 
                        places and pieces of inspiration. But finally I want to show that I’m a writer, 
                        finally put bits and pieces about this love-child I have had in the works for a 
                        while now out there. Slot myself on a shelf somewhere with the people that got 
                        me here. Super corny, I know, but it’s my dream.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>(<u>Thank you to my mother, for making me read, and authors like Liz Kessler, 
                        Chris Colfer, and Soman Chainani for keeping tiny-tot me reading</u>)
