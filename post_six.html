                    <br>
                    <p>So, as a writer, running a writing blog, I will be one hundred million 
                        gazillion percent honest with saying, <b>this blog will not have ai 
                        at all!</b>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are some scientific benefits, I will say. Like that ai that was 
                        used to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-powered-breast-cancer-detection-mits-breakthrough-algorithm-noela-pf9ic">
                            find cancer cells in a woman’s breasts before it was detectable,</a>
                        but in an artistic place? In a generative space? It’s vile.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To train an ai, it has to be fed information. To train an ai to write, 
                        it has to be fed writing. I know of a couple friends and professors 
                        who’ve had their work fed to an ai, hell, even my own work has been. 
                        And it’s just, morally, not fun. At first, all I knew about was the 
                        stealing of people’s work. Then it came to light <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cindygordon/2024/02/25/ai-is-accelerating-the-loss-of-our-scarcest-natural-resource-water">the effect on the environment.</a> 
                        The amount of water it takes to cool the facilities that 
                        run the ai processors is astronomical. I’m not a science person, I don’t 
                        know the ins and outs of these systems. I am a person of the humanities–a 
                        writer–but I take a stand when it comes to the destruction of our 
                        environment.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are things only people can experience, only people can describe, 
                        feel, and show. The humanities and the arts are important in ways outside 
                        of scientific discoveries, and with the increased usage of generative ai 
                        to attempt to replace that and call it “art” is taking away from human 
                        capabilities and creativity. And to take away those thought processes, 
                        the challenges that come with personally generating ideas and working on 
                        them and creative notions, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf">has been shown already to damage our cognition.</a> 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I stand by this blog, by the process of writing. Write shitty, write it 
                        without a clue of how it’ll end, write it from just a scene, write it 
                        without a plan, <i>just write it</i>. Let it come from you and what <i>you</i> want 
                        to make, and don’t let your idea be fed into some bigger, harmful 
                        machine, and create it however you can.
