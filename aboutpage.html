                    Hi there!! My name's Emma, and this is my blog (kinda obvi but yeahh).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    I'm a creative (typically fiction) writer and have been writing for a good 
                    chunk of my life now. I've come across this problem, however, where getting 
                    into a writing "flow" (or maybe groove is a better word) was just hard to do.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    When I'd brought this up to some other friends of mine, they'd ask if there was 
                    any advice out there for HOW to stay in that flow, or even start a project and 
                    stick with it. I'd ended up coming across a couple vidoes, text posts, and personal 
                    posts on social medias, but never anything <i>more</i>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    From there, I thought "Why?". Why was there no in-depth writer-made site or forum 
                    where writers talked about the process of writing? Because—if anything—writing is 
                    100% a process.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    So I decided, "fuck it, i'm going to find a way to make a thing that follows 
                    my writing process" and this was born.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This blog is a love-child of a writer wanting to get themself to write, 
                    and the process as a helpful little "relatableness" for other writers too! A
                    lot of people write, but usually the creative process is very "free-flowing"
                    and "hard to describe". So why not legitamently follow along with someone going
                    through it?
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally, This website was coded and completed by me !! 
                    <p>(I learned html just to make this lol)</p>
